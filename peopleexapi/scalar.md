# Scalars
Scalars are primitive values: `Int`, `Float`, `String`, `Boolean`, or `ID`.

When calling the GraphQL API, you must specify nested subfield until you return only scalars.

## String
The `String` scalar type represents textual data, represented as UTF-8 character sequences. The String type is most often used by GraphQL to represent free-form human-readable text.

## Int
The `Int` scalar type represents non-fractional signed whole numeric values. Int can represent values between -(2^31) and 2^31 - 1. 

## Boolean
The `Boolean` scalar type represents `true` or `false`.
